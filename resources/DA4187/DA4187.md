The DA 4187 is an [XFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XFA) Foreground(XFAF) form. The XFA data schema can be viewed in the 4187_data.xml file. Most of the fields are relatively self-explanatory, but the 4187 PDF in this directory provides the corresponding layout locations for the example data in the XML file.

### Field-Specific Notes

* EFFECITIVE: This is a typo in the original form itself, and any XML used to fill this form should use this node name exactly.
* TYPACT nodes: The PDF has three columns of actions - these correspond to A, B, and C nodes respectively. The rows in each column are *de facto* zero-indexed from the top row. Thus, TYPACT_A_1 is the second row of the first column, "ROTC or Reserve Component Duty."
  * The exception to this is TYPACT_D, which corresponds to the Other checkbox. This checkbox is separate from the OTHER node, which is where the text for that field is stored. If TYPACT_D is set to 0, then the form's JavaScript will clear the data in the OTHER node (TODO: check to see if it clears the node or just blanks the display).
* group5: This represents the radio buttons in Section V, box 11. They are numbered 2-6, starting from left to right. 
* Page 2 blocks: The majority of page 2 consists of four identical sections. These are referenced in the XML as A, B, C, and D, respectively. For each of those sections, the To block is the ORG node, and the From block is the OFFICE node.
